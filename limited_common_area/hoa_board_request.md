Hello

We would like to discus with the HOA board why we will continue to use our Limited Common Area as Washington County documents clearly state we are entitled to:

Washington County Documents

PAGE 4 DECLARATION Book 1060 Page 569

Section 3.3 Unit Designation

Unit 43 , Space: 1252 , Percentage of Interest in Common Elements 1.8765

PAGE 5 - DECLARATION Book 1060 page 570

4 - General Common Elements.

Each unit shall be entitled to a percentage ownership in the general common elements as set forth above in Section 3.3 and shall be liable for the general common expenses in the same proportion.


Thanks...

John and Mary Telford
