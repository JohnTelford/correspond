A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence that uses interconnected nodes to process data. It is inspired by the biological neural networks in the human brain and is used to recognize patterns, classify data, and make decisions. Neural networks are composed of layers of connected neurons, each of which performs a specific task. The input layer takes in raw data, while the output layer produces the final result. Hidden layers between the input and output layers can be used to increase the accuracy of the neural network's predictions. By adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons, the neural network can learn from its mistakes and become more accurate over time.
