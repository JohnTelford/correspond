Backpropagation is an algorithm used in artificial neural networks to calculate the error contribution of each neuron after a batch of data. It is commonly used in supervised learning, in which a desired output value is known for each input value and the network must learn to generate suitable outputs. The algorithm works by propagating the error backward from the output layer through the hidden layers and adjusting the weights of the connections between them. This process is repeated until the network converges on a set of weights
