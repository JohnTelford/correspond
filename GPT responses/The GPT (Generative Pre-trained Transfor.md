GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a deep learning-based language model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to generate natural language from a given prompt with context-appropriate grammar, syntax and vocabulary. GPT can be used for tasks such as summarizing text, question answering, machine translation and natural language generation.
